# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Domain Modeling

We need domain modeling in order to determine the popularity of dog videos by providing self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.

## HTML Table Basics
Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
<br>
***Tables can create tag soup and are not accessibility friendly for users who may be visually impared.***
<br>
List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML table.
  <br>
  ***With semantic elements, you can use the th element (th stands for table header). 
  This works in exactly the same way as a td, except that it denotes a header, not a normal cell. 
  Go into your HTML, and change all the td elements surrounding the table headers into th elements.***

  ## Introducing Constructors
  
 What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
  
  ***A constructor is used to create more than one object from a single object definition for example needing to define a shape of an object.***
  
How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?  
  
  ***This differs in the meaning of using an object literal to only create one object versus more than one with a constructor.***
